this thing steals weather data like you've never seen
--------------------------------------------------------
made for ics h32 at uc irvine, fall '25

grabs the weather data for a particular location (in the united states), and can be queried for various quantities

the input has to be in a very specific format (specified at https://ics.uci.edu/~thornton/icsh32/ProjectGuide/Project3/)

also comes with some test data

nothing crazy, just thought this was cool enough to share!
